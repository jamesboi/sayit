# SayIt :loudspeaker:

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/pviotti/gh-pipelines/_apis/build/status/pviotti.sayit?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/pviotti/gh-pipelines/_build/latest?definitionId=3&branchName=master)  

SayIt is a simple command line tool that pronounces written text.
You can use it to create audio recordings of your text files or
to improve your pronunciation in a foreign language.

## Installation

SayIt uses [Azure Cognitive Services][az-cs] as backend to guarantee
optimal audio quality, so it requires a subscription to Azure, which you can get for free
[here][az-sub].
Azure Cognitive Services [free tier][az-cs-price] includes 5 text-to-speech
hours per month, which is often enough for personal use.
